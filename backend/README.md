## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

### 2. Create a virtual environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated:

Linux/macOS:

bash
Copiar código
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Windows:

```bash
Copiar código
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies:

```bash
Copiar código
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
